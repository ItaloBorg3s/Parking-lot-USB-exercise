## üõ°Ô∏è Mitigation Strategies

Educating employees on the risks of USB devices, using endpoint protection solutions, and enforcing policies to block unauthorized USB devices can significantly reduce the chances of an attack. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) also adds an additional layer of protection to limit access to sensitive data.

**Stay secure and always think before plugging in unknown devices!**
